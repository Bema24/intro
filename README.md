### About our project
-Pong is a simple sports table tennis simulator. A small square, replacing a ping-pong ball, moves along the screen along a linear path. If it hits the perimeter of the playing field, then its trajectory changes. If the ball is hit by the player's racket, then its movement additionally depends on the speed and direction of the racket. Rackets in Pong are controlled by a paddle controller, which is controlled by turning the handle around its axis. The perimeter of the playing field is indicated by the edges of the screen, and the ball cannot leave the field through the top or bottom edge. At the top of the field, the points of the players are displayed, each on its own half of the screen
